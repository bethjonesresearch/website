::: {.callout-note}

I first wrote this blog draft back in 2022, and it has been edited and 
resurrected for this version of my site. If you've been a reader for a 
while, this means you've likely read this before. I hope it's just as 
useful this time around!

## Workflow

The thing about doctorates is that there is a huge amount of 
flexibility in what each one looks like, and what life is like for you 
during yours. You may have coursework, modules, or milestones to do 
along the way, but you also have one **really** big deadline (whether 
that's a thesis or portfolio) at least 3 years from your start date. 
You may have come to your doctorate from work or professional life, 
or from studying, from caring responsibilities, or travel, or a career 
break.

No two paths or doctorate journeys are the same, and the day-to-day 
life of doctorates will be equally varied and diverse. Finding a 
routine and structure to let you get the work done without it taking 
over your life is really important for actually being able to enjoy your doctorate. 

I came to my PhD from working full time and studying for an MSc in my 
evenings part time, so the idea of just having the one thing to think 
about felt pretty good. I came into a team and with a supervisor who 
strongly encouraged me to keep some form of regular hours (whether 
that was 8-4, 9-5 or similar) to maintain momentum and to spend time 
with the researchers around me to learn from them. My PhD experience 
was also shaped by the fact that I did it in the Before Times, and 
have a health condition that means I can be fatigued in the mornings 
so need to manage my energy carefully through the day.  

So during my PhD, my “getting stuff done” system looked like this:


### Organisation
To take responsibility for holding everything about my PhD out of my 
head (it got pretty full after a while), I used an app called 
[Todoist](http://todoist.com/). This is available in web browser form 
and also in an app which I kept on my phone for those 4am or bike 
ride thoughts. 

When I first wrote this blog in 2022, this was my set up on the app. 
You'll see it includes a list of papers I planned to read, ideas I had
for projects or papers or general thoughts for work (they included my
“writing backlog” list).

At the time of my PhD I had an overall “Project management” section, a
PhD admin” section for booking travel, writing minutes, completing 
forms etc., and a subsection for each project that contributed to my 
thesis. When it came to thesis writing, I also had a Thesis subsection
with a to do list for each chapter. Todoist has a free tier with a 5
project maximum, but I use the paid premium option. It became a 
lifeline during my PhD for keeping track of where I am. The way that
I use this app has evolved over time, but as a newcomer to managing
a long-term project it was a real help during my PhD. 


### Notes and minutes
My reading from articles and reports was stored on my university cloud 
in a central “Reading and Thoughts” document. I'm a piler, not a filer, 
which became really useful towards the end of the writing process as I 
found that everything was in one place when I needed to find that 
*one* paper that said something crucial. Keeping it on the University 
system also meant that it was backed up every day.

My abstract thinking, draft minutes, and project mapping tended to 
happen on paper in an “everything notebook” (See [Dr Raul Pacheco-Vega’s amazing blog posts](http://www.raulpacheco.org/resources/the-everything-notebook) on PhDs and notebooks). This notebook tended to live at work in my desk drawer,
but I started carrying it with me everywhere towards the last year of 
my PhD in case I thought of some phrasing for my thesis.

### Productivity
I shamelessly **LOVE** a Gantt chart. Part of my PhD registration 
process required a Gantt chart, and I started a habit of putting the 
tasks for that month into a calendar slot for me for the first working
day of each month. This helps me to know where my energy needs to go 
that month and helped me keep my project to time. I also made a thesis 
writing Gantt chart at about the 18 months stage, but thats a post 
for another time. 


I like working using the Pomodoro technique (25 minutes of writing, 
5 minutes break and described in a great way by [Prof Inger Mewburn at the Thesis Whisperer blog](https://thesiswhisperer.com/2011/06/02/another-way-to-write-1000-words-a-day)). I decided that for me, 10 
focused pomodoros every work day (about 5 hours of work) was enough 
for me to maintain momentum during my PhD. This went up to 12 (so about
6 hours) during my final year. This meant that the amount of time I 
spent actually working was in my hands and dependent on my focus.

Meetings and talks and similar all counted towards this total for me 
and I tracked it using - you guessed it - a Todoist list. This had 10 
“Pomodoro tick boxes” that were set to recur every work day. If I 
didn’t get that many done, I didn’t beat myself up about it. A 
doctorate is a marathon, not a sprint but I found that this amount of 
time reading/writing/thinking/meeting kept momentum going for me and 
held me accountable for my time. This also meant if all my pomodoros 
were done by 3pm then I’d go home guilt free!  

I help keep focus and mark time during my pomodoros using the [Forest app](https://www.forestapp.cc) that gives me a little tree to keep alive, and if I play with my phone in that time then the tree dies and I feel guilty about virtual
tree murdering. There’s a Chrome extension too. For those who prefer 
analogue approaches to time tracking, please enjoy this picture of a 
snazzy set of egg timers I got from my partner:

#### I'm always interested in what peoples' workflows look like, what does yours look like?
