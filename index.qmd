I'm Beth and I am a health researcher with experience in long-term condition research and NHS workforce research. I'm interested in qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods research and also have a strong interest in public involvement in research.

This site is a record of my CV and a place where I blog about some of my reflections and experiences. I hope it will serve as a record of lessons Iâ€™ve learned about research methods, life in academia, and early career issues along the way.
