    "section": "",
    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nI first wrote this blog draft back in 2022, and it has been edited and resurrected for this version of my site. If you’ve been a reader for a while, you may read this before. I hope it’s just as useful this time around!\n\n\nWorking in academia means that you often need to apply for things (jobs, grant applications, fellowships) that are very competitive. Statistics from UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) suggest that the success rate from grant applications was 21% in 2021. This means that around 4 out of 5 people who applied for grants via UKRI competitive funding processes were left disappointed.\nRejection or not succeeding in applications is one thing, but the amount of work required to submit a grant application is often large. A fellowship application (a type of funding that is typically several years long and funds a specific researcher with a specific project they designed to develop as a researcher as well as carry out the project) can take months to develop and submit, sometimes with more t han one stage of the application. This can make the process of not getting funding feel all the more painful and personal.\nThe good news for you is that I have had a lot of practice at dealing with rejection. I’ve been very fortunate to have a few small successful grants (both leading the grant and as a co-applicant supporting other people’s work). Just by myself I’ve applied for (and been unsuccessful with) four different fellowship applications with more than one proposed project. That’s a lot of hard work and a lot of being disappointed. I’ve found that I really enjoy developing my research ideas into a project and always really believe in the ideas I submit. I’ve gotten to interview stages, or fallen just short of getting funding so sometimes it’s been so close that I can find myself daydreaming about how much I’ll enjoy the project, or what it would be like to do it. I’ve become better at dusting myself off and grieving for the experiences I imagined having when developing the application.\nIn this blog post, I’m sharing my best advice and tips for coping with unsuccessful applications based on plenty of trial and error of what works for me.\n\nTip #1: Update your manager/co-applicants, and turn your email off\nEmails or letters that open with “We are sorry to inform you…” are never welcome, let’s be honest. It’s tough, but it’s also tough to be the bearer of bad news to other people. It’s good practice to let your co-applicants who contributed to the application know that it has not been successful, as well as anyone who wrote a letter of support or similar. They will likely have to report on the outcome to their university systems and update their own records, and it’s courteous to let them know after they spent time helping.\nIn my experience, the kind of people who are so lovely that you want to work with them are also the kind of people to send generous and supportive emails expressing sympathies if you don’t get a grant application. I’m often not in the mental space to read those emails straight away, so I put them into a “Kind Emails” folder, to read a few weeks on when it doesn’t feel so raw and to keep for those difficult days. A few weeks later, they are often uplifting and encouraging boosts to my confidence.\n\n\nTip #2: Take time to feel the disappointment\nThe first time I got a rejection on a grant application it felt way more painful than I’d expected it to. I found myself playing down my disappointment to try and appear more “professional”, like I knew that this was a common outcome and I understood that it was part of academic life. The second time I tried to do the same thing, even though I’d adapted the first application based on feedback, strengthened it, and spent another 9 months going through the process of refining it, doing the admin for submission, and waiting for the outcome. I felt pretty glum, and worried that I didn’t have “what it took” to be an academic if I’d had these two unsuccessful applications in row. These days, with more experience of both types of grant application outcomes I know I need to create some space for me to feel sad, or angry, or disappointed, or like an imposter before I can move on. It takes so long to go through the application process that we should allow some time to say goodbye to the future we imagined when we planned the grant. I find this process tends to take a few days, and is usually less raw after a week.\n\n\nTip #3: Do the stuff that makes you feel better\nIn this time, do what feels good in the moment. I know that for me I feel better after some exercise (usually a run or weightlifting) with early 2000s emo music to help me get into the mindset of sitting with the disappointment rather than push it down, baths, and time spent video-calling my small nieces who make me laugh. Certain podcasts have also become part of my routine that talk about academia realistically rather than the rose-tinted lens. This episode of a favourite podcast of mine, On the Reg talks about dealing with the emotional challenges of academia and gives me space to really feel any sadness about what could have been.It’s easy to only see other peoples’ successes, so this helps me to validate that we’re in a tough industry and in competitive roles.\n\n\nTip #4: Looking after yourself\nI’ve talked a lot about how I respond to disappointment, but I also want to reflect on trying not to let difficult feelings about work take over. If you can, try not to think about work outside of work for too long. If you’re able to, try to stick to a regular sleep schedule and eat foods that feel good but also nourish your body, with some time outdoors, exercise, or movement if this is possible for you. You’ll find a routine that works for you through trial and error.\n\n\nTip #5: In time, review the feedback and consider a next step\nI know I am not ready to review feedback and think about whether I can repackage and submit the work, or whether it is best to archive the project for at least a month after I get the response. After a while though, when I have more distance from the response I can step back and critically evaluate the project in light of the feedback.\nDiscuss the outcome and feedback with your team of co-applicants and supervisors to consider the next appropriate step. I submitted an amended grant application to 3 different funders (building on feedback each time) before deciding that it perhaps wasn’t the best time for this project and that I should build up underpinning evidence first.\n\n\nTip #6: Don’t be put off trying again\nIt’s not always easy to adapt and resubmit a grant, but you and your co-applicants and mentors believed in this idea enough to put in so much hard work to submit it. Lots and lots of unsuccessful applications represent ideas that are strong and will make the world better, so don’t think because it has been unsuccessful once that it will be unsuccessful again!\n\n\nIn summary,\nGrant applications are a big part of working in academia, and lots of us are often high achievers not used to getting “no” as an answer. We put a lot of our time and our soul and our ideas into these applications. so it is understandably painful when we don’t get them. Taking time to feel sad about them, creating a routine of activities to help cope, and taking the time to critically reassess your next steps can help to make the disappointment bearable. I’d be really interested to hear how other people respond to setbacks like this!"

    "text": "I’ve been keeping a research journal for almost a decade now for reading notes, ideas, and reflections on analysis. Nothing has shaped my thinking on this like the book Making the Most of Your Research Journal by Dr Nicole Brown. Dr Brown’s book talks about the value of finding a research journal style that works for you so you are more likely to maintain it and contribute to it. I’ve always maintained a digital system, initially keeping my PhD reading notes in Microsoft Word documents and the same for all my meeting minutes. My reflections were often dictated directly into Microsoft Word using the dictate function so I wasn’t tempted to self-edit as I go. When I discovered OneNote, I moved lock, stock and barrel into OneNote for everything, following Tiago Forte’s PARA system with separate notebooks for Projects, Areas, Resources, and an Archive.\nThe joy of a digital system, as Dr Brown’s book will tell you, is the ability to keep digital media like videos, screenshots and links all in one place. I’ve dabbled with using NotebookLM to summarise papers into podcasts when they are full of theoretical detail or hard to follow and these can be incorporated into OneNote pages. I also like the OneNote system where you can enter meeting details (including attendee lists and meeting name) at the top of a document to aid my notetaking and reflections. I love the more creative and artistic examples in the research journal book which include quilts and clay, but I’m just not there yet!\nThings that go into my journal include:\n\nReading notes, with my own ideas or unanswered questions highlighted in yellow to stand out from notes about the paper.\nMeeting minutes and reflections, including actions that I can incorporate into a task tracker.\nMind maps of ideas as I try to understand potentially related concepts in my field.\nDesigns of research materials e.g., interview schedules.\nFirst drafts of writing (I try to write 250 words a day, even if it’s not about a specific project but is about my field).\nNetworking information (the “People to follow up on” list that Dr Brown refers to after conferences or meetings).\nGoal setting or targets, broken down into SMART goals I can review at the end of the quarter for myself. If I’m in a job with first-year probation goals, these get incorporated here.\nA live link to any project Gantt charts, rather than keep a separate copy here that can end up on a different timeline to the original if I make edits.\nA “stuff to go in my CV” tracker (referred to in the book by the more professional “Achievement Tracker”) as I don’t know about you, but my CV gets updated in bursts rather than live.\n\nAs a qualitative researcher, reflections and reflexivity help me to think, and Dr Brown refers to journalling as a process of active decision making, as well as crucial for researcher wellbeing. The book includes practical guidance on templates, specific types of entries, reflections on the ethics of research journalling and the role a journal can play in forming your identity as a researcher. It was a hugely formative book in helping me understand my voice and a holistic approach to my approach to research and I would fully recommend reading it!\nIf you’re definitely a hard-copy kind of person, I have to flag another important resource for you. Both the book and my own journey for the perfect journalling system brought me to the work of Dr Raul Pacheco-Vega. Dr Pacheco-Vega writes about the benefit of an Everything Notebook. His website provides detailed and practical advice on setting up and maintaining a hard copy Everything Notebook, which for these purposes can be a research journal. It’s always inspiring and it always makes me want to go buy new stationery.\n\nWhat is your system for managing knowledge as part of your research? What would your research journal look like?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nI first wrote this blog draft back in 2022, and it has been edited and resurrected for this version of my site. If you’ve been a reader for a while, you may have read this before. I hope it’s just as useful this time around!\n\n\nAs a researcher, I spend chunks of my time in work interviewing people about their thoughts and experiences to collect data. I’ve done well over 500 interviews, so I’ve had time to reflect on some patterns in my thoughts and feelings when I interview someone. A challenge of interviews is that your focus needs to be in a few different places at once.\n\nFirst, your focus needs to be in the moment, listening to what your participant is saying. You also want to be sure that your participant knows you are listening and that you respect the time and personal experience they are sharing with you.\nSecond, your brain is holding what people have told you in the conversation already, so that you can come back to it later in the interview if you want. You may be using an interview schedule with semi-structured interviews so may be mentally holding this up against a virtual timeline. You also want to ask thoughtful and relevant questions to unpick their experiences or perspectives based on what they have told you already.\nWhile this isn’t encouraged, you might also find yourself thinking long-term during this conversation. For example, you might wonder whether this data collection is in line with literature you’ve read on the topic, or whether it seems like it lines up with what other participants have told you. As I become more and more experienced, I am more able to ignore this part of my brain and focus on the conversation, rather than whether it fits with my expectations of the conversation.\n\nInterviewing research participants is a skill, and I found it took practice to learn to hold all of this in my head at once and still ask thoughtful questions to generate rich qualitative data.\n\nI also know that I have an extra layer of thought during qualitative data collection that covers my confidence in myself as an interviewer. I really notice it during minutes 15-30 of interview data collection. I’ve talked about this with a few other qualitative researchers, some identified with this feeling, and some didn’t. I’ve decided to talk about it (and the strategies I use to manage it).\n\nSo, let’s be honest\nI have an irrational discomfort during minutes 15-30 when collecting interview data. I’ve tried to unpick it here. It is built around the idea that I will start the interview smoothly, break the ice with some opening questions to start the discussion and then for no real reason at all, the participant and I will run out of stuff to talk about, and the interview will be cut short in a really awkward way. I hold this extra brain space for worry about whether the data I’m collecting is rich enough and whether I’m doing a good enough job as an interviewer to help the participant feel able to share their experience with me and generate “good” data. This is irrational. I know it is irrational because:\n\nThere’s nothing actually wrong with an interview being short. Qualitative research is interested in depth and richness of data, not how long it took for you to collect it. This is based on an incorrect assumption of some unconscious part of my brain that a longer interview = better. Sometimes it isn’t, and shorter interviews are necessary for practical reasons. For example, it would not be ethical as a researcher to conduct overly long interviews with people with health conditions that mean that a 1-hour interview with me would leave them fatigued and drained for several days afterwards. People might also be busy, but have valuable expertise that can really help a research study and so can only spare 15-20 minutes of their time for an interview.\nSometimes an interview might be short, but we cover all we need in that time. Longer interviews don’t guarantee rich data. Despite my fear of running out of stuff to talk about, there is usually an interview schedule there to guide discussion. There’s no pressure for participants to talk for so long that we run for over 30 minutes, but there will likely be some kind of list of questions or topic guide there for me to rely on. I most commonly collect data using semi-structured interviews so ask questions or discuss things that are not on the interview schedule, and this is common. This means that I’ve got plenty available to me to ask about during minutes 15 to 30, or I can pick up threads that the participant started talking about and ask them to tell me more.\nCrucially, this “running out of stuff to talk about” hasn’t actually happened to me before. A participant and I tend to get talking when we start the interview and set the scene and move our way through our “conversation with a purpose” easily. People tend to choose to take part in research that relates to them, or that they are interested in and this tends to mean that they have stuff to say on the topic. This will help, and this will benefit you.\n\nI find that once my interview hits the 30-minute mark I tend to relax. This also means that my interview technique is always better, and the interview flows more comfortably. I feel more relaxed and more able to get the best out of my participants because I’m more in the moment, more responsible to the little things they tell me that I want to know more about, and more able to actively listen. Even though I know this, every single time I do an interview, I worry during minutes 15-30.\nSo what to do about this?\nFor those who may also struggle with worrying about their data collection actually getting in the way of their data collection, I’ve picked up a few techniques along the way to help!\n\nWhen I start recording, I cover the time up for a little while. It’s important to be respectful of participants’ time and not overrun, but I feel more relaxed when I cover the clocks for a little while to start. This involves flipping my Dictaphone screen down (if I’m using one) once I’ve checked it’s recording, and sometimes using a sticky note on my computer clock to stop me peeking. I have to remove this at some point during the interview to be sure that I don’t take up too much of the participants’ time but not being able to see it all the time takes some of the struggle out of it.\nWhere I can, I pilot my interview schedule with a colleague and ask them to be deliberately vague so I can figure out where my “unpicking points” are, where I might ask them to expand or tell me more on specific questions to understand more about the topic and their experiences.\nI have a few questions on my interview schedule highlighted as “minutes 15-30” questions, so once we’ve broken the ice, I know it’ll open up discussion of the topic.\nSitting with the knowledge that the data I collect will be ok, and that the experiences that participants share will tell me something meaningful in some way, and that’s always appreciated.\n\n\nI’d be interested to know other peoples’ experiences of their thoughts and planning when they carry out qualitative research, or if anyone has a similar 15-30 minute problem!"

    "section": "Workflow",
    "text": "Workflow\nThe thing about doctorates is that there is a huge amount of flexibility in what each one looks like, and what life is like for you during yours. You may have coursework, modules, or milestones to do along the way, but you also have one really big deadline (whether that’s a thesis or portfolio) at least 3 years from your start date. You may have come to your doctorate from work or professional life, or from studying, from caring responsibilities, or travel, or a career break.\nNo two paths or doctorate journeys are the same, and the day-to-day life of doctorates will be equally varied and diverse. Finding a routine and structure to let you get the work done without it taking over your life is really important for actually being able to enjoy your doctorate.\nI came to my PhD from working full time and studying for an MSc in my evenings part time, so the idea of just having the one thing to think about felt pretty good. I came into a team and with a supervisor who strongly encouraged me to keep some form of regular hours (whether that was 8-4, 9-5 or similar) to maintain momentum and to spend time with the researchers around me to learn from them. My PhD experience was also shaped by the fact that I did it in the Before Times, and have a health condition that means I can be fatigued in the mornings so need to manage my energy carefully through the day.\nSo during my PhD, my “getting stuff done” system looked like this:\n\nOrganisation\nTo take responsibility for holding everything about my PhD out of my head (it got pretty full after a while), I used an app called Todoist. This is available in web browser form and also in an app which I kept on my phone for those 4am or bike ride thoughts.\nWhen I first wrote this blog in 2022, this was my set up on the app. You’ll see it includes a list of papers I planned to read, ideas I had for projects or papers or general thoughts for work (they included my “writing backlog” list).\n\n\n\nTodoist workflow showing the following list of categories: projects, week view, papers to read, a personal section, and big ideas.\n\n\nAt the time of my PhD I had an overall “Project management” section, a PhD admin” section for booking travel, writing minutes, completing forms etc., and a subsection for each project that contributed to my thesis. When it came to thesis writing, I also had a Thesis subsection with a to do list for each chapter. Todoist has a free tier with a 5 project maximum, but I use the paid premium option. It became a lifeline during my PhD for keeping track of where I am. The way that I use this app has evolved over time, but as a newcomer to managing a long-term project it was a real help during my PhD.\n\n\nNotes and minutes\nMy reading from articles and reports was stored on my university cloud in a central “Reading and Thoughts” document. I’m a piler, not a filer, which became really useful towards the end of the writing process as I found that everything was in one place when I needed to find that one paper that said something crucial. Keeping it on the University system also meant that it was backed up every day.\nMy abstract thinking, draft minutes, and project mapping tended to happen on paper in an “everything notebook” (See Dr Raul Pacheco-Vega’s amazing blog posts on PhDs and notebooks). This notebook tended to live at work in my desk drawer, but I started carrying it with me everywhere towards the last year of my PhD in case I thought of some phrasing for my thesis.\n\n\nProductivity\nI shamelessly LOVE a Gantt chart. Part of my PhD registration process required a Gantt chart, and I started a habit of putting the tasks for that month into a calendar slot for me for the first working day of each month. This helps me to know where my energy needs to go that month and helped me keep my project to time. I also made a thesis writing Gantt chart at about the 18 months stage, but thats a post for another time.\nI like working using the Pomodoro technique (25 minutes of writing, 5 minutes break and described in a great way by Prof Inger Mewburn at the Thesis Whisperer blog). I decided that for me, 10 focused pomodoros every work day (about 5 hours of work) was enough for me to maintain momentum during my PhD. This went up to 12 (so about 6 hours) during my final year. This meant that the amount of time I spent actually working was in my hands and dependent on my focus.\nMeetings and talks and similar all counted towards this total for me and I tracked it using - you guessed it - a Todoist list. This had 10 “Pomodoro tick boxes” that were set to recur every work day. If I didn’t get that many done, I didn’t beat myself up about it. A doctorate is a marathon, not a sprint but I found that this amount of time reading/writing/thinking/meeting kept momentum going for me and held me accountable for my time. This also meant if all my pomodoros were done by 3pm then I’d go home guilt free!\nI help keep focus and mark time during my pomodoros using the Forest app that gives me a little tree to keep alive, and if I play with my phone in that time then the tree dies and I feel guilty about virtual tree murdering. There’s a Chrome extension too. For those who prefer analogue approaches to time tracking, please enjoy this picture of a snazzy set of egg timers I got from my partner:\n\n\n\nPhoto of three glass egg timers marking 5, 10, and 30 minutes.\n\n\n\nI’m always interested in what peoples’ workflows look like, what does yours look like?"

If you’ve been a reader for a while this means you’ve likely read this before. I hope it’s just as useful this time around!\n\n\nI’m going to open this post by telling you that there are literally hundreds of people who know more about this than I do. I’m also going to tell you that there are posts that will be more detailed and comprehensive and expert than mine, and I’ll link to some of them at the bottom. With that in mind, I’ve decided to write this anyway. I know plenty of PhD students who are in the early stages of their PhD and are feeling at a bit of a loss about how to actually get started writing their thesis. There is amazing work there about writing tiny texts and weaving red threads of narrative through your thesis. Where I come in is the process of getting started, and getting something down on paper.\nBlank documents are scary. I wrote my thesis in Microsoft Word (I sometimes use other programmes like Scrivener or LaTeX, but it suited my supervisors and my work computer better). To get around the fear of the blank page, I created a fresh document for every chapter so I wasn’t overwhelmed by all of the blankness, and put the title for each chapter along with a few sentences of what the chapter may cover. For example, for methods this was:\n“Here is my methods chapter and I’ll talk about my study design and why I chose it, my ethics approvals, my recruitment and any other stuff.”\nAs you’ll see, it’s pretty colloquial and not the “grown-up” language of academia, but it got me started and gave me a road map for everything else.\n\n\n\nOpening to a chapter, including the questions “what came up? What does this mean?”\n\n\nCreating an outline was a required part of my progression process, and for me it was a really useful tool to get a sense of what I might write. Colleagues shared examples of their theses with me so I could understand some potential structures for literature reviews, or what sections were expected at my institution. I then decided what sub-sections may be useful in my own chapter - with variations in levels of detail depending on how much I had done so far. For example, this is a Winter 2017 document (I started my PhD in October 2016). I had started thinking about how I might introduce the project into Inflammatory Arthritis (IA), and what models I may need to introduce the reader to. As I had time to get to grips with some of the literature, this was fairly detailed and I had a sense of how many words these sections might be.\n\n\n\nStructure of my planned PhD thesis, with subsections and word counts for each chapter\n\n\nHowever, there are sections I did not know much about yet. For example, my findings and discussion chapter for the second stage of my qualitative study. As you can see, it’s still pretty vague. I knew that the maximum thesis word count for my institution was 80,000 words and mine hovers at about 70,000 words. This helped me figure out loosely how many words would be dedicated to each chapter and gave me a goal for each one. Most of my chapter sizes ended up pretty close, with quantitative results taking fewer than I’d expected and my discussion running long to balance it out.\nI shared this with my supervisors, to check that there was nothing in there that they didn’t expect and to be sure I hadn’t missed anything glaring. From there, each chapter document got filled with the level of detail I had. I set myself the goal of writing 250 thesis words every working day from my second year onwards (I guesstimated I’d work 200ish days a year, and so calculated that 250 x 200 = 50,000 words a year which would get me there by the middle of my third year.)\nYes, but how to actually start writing?\nI am always caught up in the “perfect sentence vortex” (if this feels familiar, read here). I know if I can see the writing it is far easier to get sucked into playing with it, or thinking its rubbish as I go. I wrote huge portions of my thesis using dictation settings on Microsoft Word, and still use it as a way to get the scrappy first draft done. It means I can close my eyes, or take my glasses off or look away and just talk to the screen. My first draft is typically not very academic in the language, and gives me something to work with. It is also easier if you don’t know the “right” sentence but just need something to exist. As an example, here is the first draft of my methods chapter: \nThis dictated version was then edited at my leisure over time. This then became… \nSharing first drafts with anyone (especially supervisors) can feel exposing and tricky, and it is too easy to compare your first draft with someone else’s finished draft. I’m hoping by sharing mine it will help to normalise the idea of your first draft being a bit scrappy and with gaps in, sometimes not knowing what it is you are trying to say.\nThese are my tips for mapping out my thesis out of fear of actually getting started, and then getting going.

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nI first wrote this blog draft back in 2022, and it has been edited and resurrected for this version of my site. If you’ve been a reader for a while this means you’ve likely read this before. I hope it’s just as useful this time around!\nThis post is brought to you by the current UK heatwave, and the number of people I’ve spoken to who just don’t have the concentration to do much at all. When you’re having an “off” day, or you haven’t slept, or something is on your mind, or you’re burned out or overwhelmed it can feel even more pressured to deliver on doing something. Anything!\nWhen I speak to graduate students who are finding their way through their PhD, the most important piece of advice I am keen to pass on is one I learned quite early into my doctorate because of luck, not out of good practice on my part. 2 months into my PhD I was concussed and my concentration, focus, and working memory were affected for several months after. I found that sometimes I would wake up and I could concentrate for a whole work day without a problem. Sometimes I would wake up and have about 30 good minutes in me, or 2 hours, or 10 minutes.\nI learned that on those days when my brain just didn’t come to join me at work that it just wasn’t worth the fight. I could do whatever it was I had capacity to do and then stop and go home/watch tv/go on my bike, or I could push through and beat myself up sitting at my desk for 8 more hours trying and trying and trying to get stuff done and I often wouldn’t have much to show for it. Maybe a few extra sentences, or one more paper read, or a handful of emails. Nothing to justify the mental effort and psychological “ick” from telling myself I wasn’t doing enough or I was failing at my job that day. If the focus and concentration wasn’t there that day, the rest was worth way more than those extra few sentences or emails. The permission from myself to stop and rest, rather than pay that exhaustion forward to the next day and cause a cycle of bad days was crucial to learning how to keep going through the PhD process. It’s not that I didn’t want to work, it was often that my brain just wouldn’t let me.\nThis became a similar problem at early points during the COVID-19 pandemic, when everything felt worrying or frightening. More recently, I’ve also had a flare of my long-term condition that means my energy levels have been drained by fatigue. In these circumstances, I’m hired to work a specific number of hours. While I’m lucky enough to have flexibility with my time so I can work more hours on good days and fewer hours on bad days, I’ve started keeping a list of “bad day activities” that don’t require as much concentrated effort but still contribute to me doing my job well.\nSome of the items on this list are:"

    "text": "Working my brain, but resting my eyes\nListening to work-related podcasts to reduce screen-time for my eyes while taking in useful information. I have a few academic skills-related podcasts. SOme great ones include Prof Mark Reed’s excellent “Fast Track Impact” podcast covering research impact and knowledge translation and Prof Inger Mewburn and Dr Jason Downs’ “On the Reg” that discusses life in academia and productivity hacks to reclaim\ntime for what matters, like ice cream in the sun. I have also moved to the occasional audio summary of academic papers using NotebookLM but I try to use this sparingly because of eco concerns.\nOn that thread, I also keep a list of podcasts and youtube videos related to my work topic to review. Videos are becoming an increasingly common means of sharing findings and I’ve learned a great deal about my focus on workforce research from professional organisations. I find I often have more focus for videos on bad days than reading from a screen, so will often have my computer read aloud to me if I do choose to read work on an off day."

    "text": "Pacing my usual activities\nSometimes active thinking but for shorter bursts of time is a good way to spend my energy on an off day, because it concentrates my efforts on what interests me and where I would like to be with my goals in the future. I often use this time to map out research directions I’m interested in, papers I plan to write based on my “writing backlog”, or public engagement activities I’d be keen to try in the future. This often has the unintended consequence of energising me and leaving my feeling positive about my day, even if it started as a tricky one.\nShortening my pomodoros (see my description of these in the blogpost about workflow) to 3 minutes of work, 2 minutes of rest. It sounds like a really small amount of work, but it was sometimes the best way of starting something if I knew I only needed to focus for 180 secondsas a minumum.\n\nOn motivation\nI appreciate that motivation can also be a common cause of an off-day, and plan to write a future blog post covering strategies for motivation struggle in research work. The Fast Track Impact podcast has an excellent 2 part episode on motivation, and On the Reg also covers some techniques that made me laugh but actually do work (including 5-4-3-2-1-GO! Trust me).\n\n\nWhat do you do to stay productive on a day where your focus hasn’t come to the desk with you?"
